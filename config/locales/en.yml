            Exec.IO was founded in Sydney Australia on the 20th of September, 2012 to
            create a new category of online tool; the Organisational Management System (OMS).
          </p>
          <p>
            This idea for an OMS is where our name came from.  "Exec" is short for "Executive" or
            "Execute", and "I/O" is the acronym for "Input" and "Output". So our OMS software
            takes data and information in, and outputs it in such a way to successfully execute
            the expansion of your organisation.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the beginning, we wanted to make systems that were easy to use, but multi lingual by
            design.  We didn't want to make internationalization an after thought, instead all of our
            products are built from the ground up to work in any language.
