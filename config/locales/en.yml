        <h1>About Exec.IO</h1>
        <p>
          Exec.IO was founded in Sydney Australia on the 20th of September, 2012 with the goal to
          change the way the world operates by creating and providing organisational tools that are effective, efficient and simple to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the beginning, we wanted to make systems that were easy to use, but multi lingual by
          design.  We didn't want to make internationalization an after thought, instead all of our
          products are built from the ground up to work in any language.
        </p>
        <p>
          For our first project, we teamed up with <a href="%{wise_url}">WISE</a> to produce
          their online <a href="%{prosperity_planner_path}">Prosperity Planner</a> and over
          the coming year tweaked and improved the design until launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the Prosperity Planner is live, we are using the knowledge gained to release
          more quality online organisational tools to the world.

        <h1>The Prosperity Planner</h1>
        <p>
          In late 2012, Exec.IO and <a href="%{wise_url}">WISE</a> met to discuss the creating of
          an online version of their successful <a href="%{prosperity_planner_physical_url}">Prosperity
          Planner diary</a> distributed to all WISE members as a membership benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this, the <a href="%{prosperity_planner_app_url}">Prosperity Planner App</a> was born
          and released as a free Membership benefit to WISE members around the world in
          late 2013.
        </p>
        <p>
          The online version has all the tools that the physical version has, including
          Weekly and Daily Battle Plans, Calendar tools and over 40 Hubbard Management
          System topics covered in a fully searchable index.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use of the Prosperity Planner App is free for all WISE members and comes
          with a 30 day free trial for anyone looking to become a WISE member.
        </p>
