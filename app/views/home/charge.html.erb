  <p>
    Exec.io is a new company with a simple goal, to build excellent online applications to help your business flourish! Right now we provide two fantastic online services. StillAlive and StatusHub. StillAlive is an exceptional online monitoring application that cleverly tests your applications live, to ensure that any errors are picked up swiftly. StatusHub is our newest service, offering beautiful, customisable status pages hosted away from your applications, so your users can be informed even when your site has gone critical!

  <h3>
    So we charged you, how come?
  </h3>
  <p>
    This will be a recurring monthly payment from the use of our web services.  Someone in your organisation, perhaps in the IT department, or the
    folks that run your website have signed you up for one of our services.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Can I get an invoice for these charges?
  </h3>
  <p>
    We automatically send out an invoice to the email address registered as the account
    holder.  You can get a copy of the invoice from the person who has signed up for the
    service.  You can also ask them to change the email address we send invoices to
    another address if you like.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What if I can't find the person in my organisation?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Feel free to contact us at <%= mail_to "accounts@exec.io", "accounts@exec.io" %> and let us know your company name,
    your website name, the name on the credit card and the last 4 digits of card charged
    and we will help you locate who signed you up for StillAlive or StatusHub.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Can I get a refund?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Not usually.  Both the StillAlive and StatusHub services are paid monthly in advance.  You can cancel
    at any time though.
  </p>
  <h3>
    How can I cancel these charges?
  </h3>
  <p>
    This can be done through the account management pages of the relevant services. If you are unsure about your login credentials, we can help you track down whomever signed you up for our services in the first place. Simply email us at <%= mail_to "accounts@exec.io", "accounts@exec.io" %> and we will get back to you as soon as humanly possible!
